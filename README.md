# Note Taker

## Description

This application is used to write and save notes. It uses an Express.js backend and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This app has also been deployed to Heroku. 
 
 When you first launch the app, you are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When you click the link, it redirects you to the page where you can enter new notes, or see previous notes you have written. If you decide to create a new note, a save button on the top right only appears when there is content in the note's title and description section. When the note is saved, it is then displayed on the left hand side of the screen, within the notes column.
